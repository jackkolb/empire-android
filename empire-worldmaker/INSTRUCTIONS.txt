Empire Worldbuilder v1
(C) Jack Kolb 2021

This short document details how to make a playable game map
using this tool. The tool is VERY simple! Note that I developed
it using Java 11.

1. First open a background map image. This is the
world map that the user sees when playing your map, minus
the provinces.

> Click "Open Background Image" and select an image

2. If you are starting from scratch, skip this step. If you
have an existing empire map that you want to work on,
import it to load it into the worldbuilder.

> Click "Import Map Data" and select a .empiremap file

3. Fill in the meta information for the map. The work name
and your name as the author.

> Fill in the "Map Data" and "Map Author" fields

4. Now you will create a new province.

> Click the "Add Province" button

5. Draw the boundaries of the province.
Click the "Set Boundary" button and then click points on
the map to outline the province area. Use a left click to
set a snap point, and a right click to set a raw point.
When you are done, press the escape key. The snap points
will automatically snap to nearby points from other
province boundaries, while the raw points will not.

> Click the "Set Boundary" button and plot the boundaries

6. Set the province's connecting provinces which it can
attack and be attacked by. Click the "Set Connections"
button and then click provinces to connect to. The
connected provinces will turn a red color. When done,
press the escape key.

> Click the "Set Connections" button and select provinces

7. Save the province.

> Click the "Save Province" button

8. Repeat from step (4) to add all the desires provinces.

> Repeat until all provinces are added

9. When all provinces have been added, click the "Export
Data" button to save the map data as a .empireworld file.

> Click the "Export Data" button.

Enjoy!
