## Empire

This is a simple Android game I made to learn graphics with Java and LibGDX. It is buggy and will likely never actually be completed, however was quite fun to make!

The repo contains two projects:

Empire: Android/Java game.

Empire Worldmaker: Graphical utility to create maps for the game.

### Empire (Android)

This is the Android Studio project. Everything should work and build fine, minus the game's runtime bugs.

### Empire Worldmaker

This is used to create maps. Each map has a background image and a set of provinces on the map.

I created this app on Archlinux, however it should run cross-platform. Run `./run.sh` to compile and launch the program. If something fails, you likely just need to adapt the command to your platform (Ubuntu, Windows, Mac).

Read the `INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file for using the worldmaker.

### Notes

I do not plan to maintain this repository, nor ever fully complete/publish this project.
